# Exercises

## Day 1

## HTML and CSS

1. Create the layout of a website. You should use this template [here](https://www.figma.com/design/zdc6LcQRL0lorhRNqdsYxB/Academia?node-id=0-1&t=sFo86FNnB6089g0H-0)
2. It should be a page for displaying a list of racks, adding and reserving them.
3. You should create an index.html and a styles.css file.
4. The page should have a header, navigation bar with some random links, a main section, a sidebar to add a new rack and a footer.
5. You should add a reserve button to reserve a rack.
6. You can use random QR codes and content regarding the racks.
7. You should focus on using the correct HTML elements and CSS best practices.
8. The page should be responsive (I'd suggest a mobile first approach)
9. Remember that this is just a layout, no functionality is needed for now.
